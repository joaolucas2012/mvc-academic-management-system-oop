## Academic management system using Model-View-Controller (MVC) patterns and object-oriented programming with file persistence

To help you to understand what does MVC mean, let's check its definition below:

### What's MVC? 
MVC is an application design model comprised of three interconnected parts. They include the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (processes that handle input). The MVC model or "pattern" is commonly used for developing modern user interfaces. It is provides the fundamental pieces for designing a programs for desktop or mobile, as well as web applications. It works well with object-oriented programming, since the different models, views, and controllers can be treated as objects and reused within an application.

## Another question

### And what about the Object Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

## Last question

### What is a persistent file? And how can I do that in Python?
[Persistence](https://www.datastax.com/blog/2010/10/what-persistence-and-why-does-it-matter) is "the continuance of an effect after its cause is removed". In the context of storing data in a computer system, this means that the data survives after the process with which it was created has ended. In other words, for a data store to be considered persistent, it must write to non-volatile storage.
  As a developer, you may sometimes need to send complex object hierarchies over a network or save the internal state of your objects to a disk or database for later use. To accomplish this, you can use a process called serialization, which is fully supported by the standard library thanks to the [Python pickle module](https://realpython.com/python-pickle-module/).
